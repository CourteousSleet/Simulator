# Simulator

This is a simple simulator that I am doing on my
university course of "Programming simulators".

I am a newbie with Python. Hope my C++ experience
helps me to deal with all these libraries...

## Preparing
First of all you need to install some libraries,
and a Qt Designer in case if you want to edit
UI.
