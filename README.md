## Simulator

This project is a simple simulator, that I am doing on my university course on "Programming simulators".

I am a newbie with Python. Hope my C++ experience helps me to deal with all these libraries...

### Preparing

First of all, you need to install some libraries, and a Qt Designer in case you want to edit UI.

### Course Structure

In this course, we learnt how to implement in code some physical models.

These are concluded in five laboratory works:

- (I lab) Moving Points inside a 2D tube.
- (II lab) Torpedo Launcher with an interface.
- (III lab) Labyrinth.
- (IV lab) Planet System.

Below are the lab options that were assigned to me:
